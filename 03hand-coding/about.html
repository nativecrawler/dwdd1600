        <p>
            In the beginning, the times that using creativity was the main priority to focus on what makes it so engaging. I’ve been developing skills for advanced art since near the end of my elementary education, and computer technology in my youth, hobbies that I still have, enthusiasm is part of people that keep them motivating. Effective skills is the goal reach for finished projects for thinking through, I put work and effort on the current project.
I've graduated in the Web & Graphic Design program at Davis Tech, finished in 2023.
